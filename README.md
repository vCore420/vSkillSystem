FiveM Skill System created by vCore, 
currently a work in progress!

Unique and fun skill system for FiveM allowing for daily gacha spins to acquire new skills or upgrade current ones.
Rartirty basied skills with simple common skills to game breaking legendary skills.
Unique player, gun and melea skills with cool buffs and drawbacks.
The user can set up to 3 different skills at once allowing for custom and unique skill sets. 

Easily add more skills to the Nui in the skills.js and added the effect logic and revert logic in the effects.lua.


Very early stages at the moment. any help/input welcome, completely open source, I just enjoy doing this to learn!

if you want to give it a try, drop the vSkillSystem folder in with your resources and restart your server, /vskills in chat opens the menu. 


*not in full working state yet*


-Current plans todo-

save users skill info to server side to save to db. 

add more skills and effects.

add skill crafting menu allowing for 2 skills to be merged into one then allowing the user to collect the original 2 again.

some skills will clash with each other as their effect and revert logic needs to be more modular to work with multiple buffs of the same kind.
